# Screen_to_Scene

Welcome to the game where you get to be your favorite animated characters!

# Description
Screen to Scene is a game where we created a platform where you can walk into an immersive experience in the screen and see the characters standing in the scene with 3D creations of the place the characters' most iconic location. The shows that were chosen were: SpongeBob SquarePants, Regular Show, The Courage the Cowardly Dog Show, and The Amazing World of Gumball. The scenes that are included in this immerisve experience are: the park of Regular Show, the houses of SpongeBob, Patrik, Squidward, and Courage, and then the school Gumball and Darwin attend. 

These scenes will also have a secret transition that will lead you to a custom Roblox game! This game allows you to play as 1 of 6 characters, and you can choose between SpongeBob, Patrik, Mordecai, Rigby, Courage, and Gumball.
