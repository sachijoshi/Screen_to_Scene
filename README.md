# Screen_to_Scene

Welcome to the game where you get to be your favorite animated characters!

# Description
Screen to Scene is a game where we created a platform where you can walk into an immersive experience in the screen and see the characters standing in the scene with 3D creations of the place the characters' most iconic location. The shows that were chosen were: SpongeBob SquarePants, Regular Show, The Courage the Cowardly Dog Show, and The Amazing World of Gumball. The scenes that are included in this immerisve experience are: the park of Regular Show, the houses of SpongeBob, Patrik, Squidward, and Courage, and then the school Gumball and Darwin attend. 

These scenes will also have a secret transition that will lead you to a custom Roblox game! This game allows you to play as 1 of 6 characters, and you can choose between SpongeBob, Patrik, Mordecai, Rigby, Courage, and Gumball.

# Game Description

This game is an interactive adventure where players can explore, morph into different characters, and save their progress using checkpoints. When players first load in, they are greeted with an intro screen featuring smooth camera movements between two key points, creating a cinematic experience. Once the player clicks "Play," the intro screen disappears, and the Morph Menu and Reset Button become available. The Morph Menu allows players to transform into different characters, such as SpongeBob, with the camera seamlessly following the new character. Players can save their progress by touching checkpoints, which update their respawn location. If a player dies or falls off the map, they will respawn at the last checkpoint they touched. If no checkpoint is touched, the player will respawn at the starting position (Stage0). The Reset Button allows players to return to Stage0 at any time, giving them control to restart their progress if needed. This system provides a smooth, user-friendly experience with simple but effective mechanics.
